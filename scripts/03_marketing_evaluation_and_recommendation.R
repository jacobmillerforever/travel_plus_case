# Assignment 1 (IDS 572) - TravelPlus RoadsidePlus Case Study
# Contributor: Analyst 3 - Marketing Impact & Executive Recommendation Lead
#
# Objective:
#   Translate model outputs into actionable marketing guidance, quantify lift and
#   incremental value across targeting depths, and craft an executive-ready
#   recommendation balancing analytics rigor with business strategy.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - Receives model score outputs, test predictions, and variable importance
#     summaries from Analyst 2.
#   - Requires understanding of response rate benchmarks and cost assumptions
#     (can be approximated or provided by stakeholders).
#   - Access to holdout/control group data (real or hypothetical) to reason about
#     incremental lift; if not available, describe evaluation framework.
#
# Key Deliverables for this Script:
#   1. Lift tables and visualizations (by decile) for top-performing models.
#   2. Scenario analysis for targeting top 10%, 20%, 30% of customers.
#   3. Incremental lift methodology description and illustrative calculations.
#   4. Final marketing recommendation with justification, risks, and next steps.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1) Organize inputs
#   - Import model predictions/probabilities for contacted customers from Analyst 2.
#   - If available, ingest holdout/control group scores aligned with the same model.
#   - Verify consistent decile/bin assignments across contacted and holdout groups.
#
# 2) Explain role of lift in marketing
#   - Draft narrative comments describing why lift metrics are more actionable than
#     accuracy metrics for targeted campaigns.
#   - Highlight connection between lift, marketing budget efficiency, and response
#     concentration.
#
# 3) Build lift tables for contacted customers
#   - Sort contacted customers by predicted probability and assign deciles (or
#     percentiles if more granular segmentation is desired).
#   - For each decile:
#       * Compute number of customers, number of purchasers, and purchase rate.
#       * Calculate lift relative to overall average response.
#   - Summarize lift in both tabular form and plots (e.g., lift chart, cumulative
#     gains chart) for each finalist model provided by Analyst 2.
#   - Compare performance across models and annotate which deciles show strongest
#     separation.
#
# 4) Evaluate targeting scenarios (Top 10%, 20%, 30%)
#   - For each cutoff scenario, compute expected purchasers captured, marketing
#     touches required, and implied efficiency (responses per contact).
#   - If cost/revenue assumptions are available, estimate ROI or incremental profit
#     per scenario; otherwise, discuss qualitatively how costs would influence the
#     decision.
#   - Document pros/cons of each cutoff (e.g., precision vs. reach, operational
#     feasibility for call center follow-up).
#
# 5) Incorporate incremental lift perspective
#   - Outline methodology to combine contacted vs. holdout outcomes by decile:
#       * Align decile assignments for both groups using the same score thresholds.
#       * Compute response rates for contacted and holdout customers within each
#         decile.
#       * Calculate incremental lift (difference in purchase rate) and cumulative
#         incremental responses as targeting depth increases.
#   - If holdout data is unavailable, describe in comments how the team would
#     execute this analysis once control group outcomes are obtained.
#   - Discuss how incremental lift informs budget allocation and marketing ROI.
#
# 6) Formulate final recommendation
#   - Select the decile cutoff (10%, 20%, or 30%) that balances ROI, operational
#     capacity, and risk appetite; clearly articulate reasoning.
#   - Choose the preferred model (from Analyst 2's shortlist) and justify using
#     both quantitative evidence (lift, metrics) and qualitative factors
#     (interpretability, deployment complexity).
#   - Identify key customer characteristics that define the target segment and any
#     caveats (e.g., compliance considerations, data quality risks).
#   - Draft executive summary bullet points suitable for presentation to the CMO.
#   - Propose next steps (e.g., pilot campaign, monitoring plan, future data needs).
